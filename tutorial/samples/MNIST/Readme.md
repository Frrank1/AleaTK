[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a computer vision dataset consisting of handwritten digits. It is a good dataset to try out machine learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data.
This tutorial shows how to train a multinomial logistic regression, a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional neural network to predict the digit from an image.
